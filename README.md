is the code for a simple calculator where you can add, subtract, multiply and divide. If you enter data incorrectly (e.g. 5++3) the output will be “Syntax error”. Also in this calculator you cannot divide by zero (output will be “You can't divide by zero”). I have uploaded a screenshot of the resulting calculator in two folders. In the first screenshot is the task and in the second screenshot is the answer.
